# What is a do-a-thon?

It's an event centered around:
* low-fi, informal participatory programming
* getting things done (including documenting them), and building on what has come before
* encouraging remote participation, and diverse in-person participation
* inclusive activities (not just "hacking" on code) encouraged

It's also an event with a soundtrack: listen.hatnote.com.

#Â Why do a do-a-thon?

You're bored of listening to talks, and think it's more important to get busy. You want programming that supports that and is easy to organize.

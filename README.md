# Background
For the first time ever, Open Heroines will host a Doathon in the International Open Data Conference. A doathon is like a hackathon, but focused on doing rather than code. We will work on open data projects that want to add a gender lens to them or on open data projects that already focus on gender. We will also create key documentation for the Open Heroines community. 

# Specifics

## Aim: hands-on with gender data - Here is the plan:
As part of the International Open Data Conference 2018, we will host a day of a doathon in Beunos Aires, Argentina. This repo will help to coordinate the activities for that day. 

Focusing on open data and gender, we are looking to collaborate with projects that already looking on open data and gender, and help them to complete some tasks that will help them move forward in their progress and give them a stage to showcase their ideas. We will also be happy to collaborate with current open data projects that want to be more gender minded and inclusive, and will help them to build a strategy to include gedner and diveristy forwars. 

We invite men, women, and gender non-binary people to join us. Whether you are a policy maker, researcher, coder, designer or just an enthusiast, we invite you to make, hack, contribute, try, teach, design, test, learn (or just about anything!). 

# How it works

We'll be using this GitHub repository for documenting and discussing ideas before, during, and after the event, both for remote participants and everyone else who is interested. People can pitch ideas or projects they want to work on or need help with in this form 


Check out the [yellow labels](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-research-doathon/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aidea%20-label%3Ameta) for hacky ideas to work on! Feel free to propose your own, even multiple ones: having more ideas may make it easier to find people to team up with. Conversely, feel free to have a go at any of these ideas, and let us &mdash; and their proposers &mdash; know how far you've come. There are [purple](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-research-doathon/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen%20label%3Ainterests%20-label%3Ameta) labels for attendees to say what their interests and skills are, which is especially useful if they are not yet involved with one of the proposed ideas.
To present the ideas and to inform about other topics of interest, we'll be having lightning talks, which can be tracked via the [red](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-research-doathon/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen%20label%3Alightning-talks%20-label%3Ameta) labels.

There are also [light green](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-research-doathon/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ameta) labels that we're using to organize the event. Your participation is welcome here too.

* A data-centric walk around the neighbourhood
* Improving documentation for any of the above
* Improving Open Heroines website
* Improving Wikipedia pages around or with gender data
* Writing data management plans
* Writing gender data grant proposals

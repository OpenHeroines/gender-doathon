# In brief

| What is this about? | Getting started |
| --- | --- |
| We invite you, whether you're attending #IODC18 in Buenos Aires or you are a far, to a day of learning, making, and doing on September 25th 2018 to the first Gender Data Doathon   | If you like what you see here, please register for the event as an on-site or virtual participant by going to its [NEED TO ADD LINK]  |
| Add OIC | ADD PIC|

# Background
For the first time ever, Open Heroines will host a Doathon in the International Open Data Conference. A doathon is like a hackathon, but focused on doing rather than code. We will work on open data projects that want to add a gender lens to them or on open data projects that already focus on gender. We will also create key documentation for the Open Heroines community. 

# Specifics

|  Aim: hands-on with gender data | Here is the plan |

# How it works

We'll be using this GitHub repository for documenting and discussing ideas before, during, and after the event, both for remote participants and everyone else who is interested. We also have a [GOOGLE DOC]  As a remote participant, expect to be able to pitch and discuss your ideas for the weekend with all attendees. We'll be using [light orange](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-research-doathon/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen%20label%3Avirtual%20-label%3Ameta) labels for issues specific to remote attendance, and [light purple](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-research-doathon/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen%20label%3Aon-site%20-label%3Ameta) for on-site issues. Note that people in the room are welcome to use the online features as well.

Check out the [yellow labels](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-research-doathon/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aidea%20-label%3Ameta) for hacky ideas to work on! Feel free to propose your own, even multiple ones: having more ideas may make it easier to find people to team up with. Conversely, feel free to have a go at any of these ideas, and let us &mdash; and their proposers &mdash; know how far you've come. There are [purple](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-research-doathon/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen%20label%3Ainterests%20-label%3Ameta) labels for attendees to say what their interests and skills are, which is especially useful if they are not yet involved with one of the proposed ideas.
To present the ideas and to inform about other topics of interest, we'll be having lightning talks, which can be tracked via the [red](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-research-doathon/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen%20label%3Alightning-talks%20-label%3Ameta) labels.

There are also [light green](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-research-doathon/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ameta) labels that we're using to organize the event. Your participation is welcome here too.

# Ideas for the Weekend

We're organizing ideas via this repo's [issue tracker]

Ideas for activites can be:

* Building a software library (Python module/ R package/ Ruby gem etc.) to facilitate access to and processing of open data from specific sources
* A data-centric walk around the neighbourhood
* Improving documentation for any of the above
* Improving Open Heroines website
* Improving Wikipedia pages around or with gender data
* Writing data management plans
* Writing gender data grant proposals
